@section["Introduction"]{
    Welcome to Miracia @ipa['w]{miɹatsia}, a campaign setting for Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition following the fallout of a recent industrial revolution on a magical world.

    Miracia is a vast region on the planet Hunyil @ipa['w]{ˈhwɪnyil}, a gas dwarf filled with vast continents suspended in seas of air. Airships sail the open skies, fueled with the magic fuel @emph{aure} mined from the lower isles of Miracia. But the rapid pace of advancement has its price—@emph{aure} has its price, and the veins are running dry. Isles drained of their @emph{aure} lose their buoyancy and sink into the cloud sea, taking their inhabitants with them to suffocate in the depths. Who will soar, and who will sink?
