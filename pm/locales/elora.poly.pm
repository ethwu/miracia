@title{Elora}

@section["Overview"]{
    Elora @ipa['g 'w]{ɛˈloɹa} is the secret powerhouse of Miracia's Auremic Revolution. The country is situated beneath the main continent, Avrasol, spanning a vast archipelago of shattered isles. Elora only sees sunlight briefly at sunrise and sunset, as Avrasol blocks the sun during the day, making the country experience a seemingly endless night, with only brief respite. That may be just as well, however, as the monsters that thrive in the toxic depths of the world are emboldened by the sunlight, and rise to wreak mayhem at those hours.

    Without the sun, Elora cannot sustain plant life. Instead, the isles are populated by jungles of behemoth fungi. Many have bioluminescence, and glow during the hours that the sun is invisible, attracting insects and other animals. Fruits, vegetable, and other plant-based foods are scarce, and must be shipped via airship.

    Thanks to its proximity to the planetary core, Elora is rich in @emph{aure}, and as @emph{aure} supplies in the upper isles have been depleted, eyes have turned to Elora to fuel the furnaces that turn the cogs of change. Mining operations in Elora are vast and expansive, and accidents frequently result in entire isles collapsing into the sea, but the gold is sorely needed in a nation with little else to offer. Outlanders own most mining operations.
