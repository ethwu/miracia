@title{Irina}

@section["Overview"]{
    Irina @ipa['w]{iˈɹinə} is the birthplace of the airship, a vast, frigid plateau woven with uncrossable rivers and hidden crevasses, bordered by Avrasol's tallest mountains.

    While no longer the naval superpower it once was, Irina still controls the primary shipping route to Elora, the Undercrossing. This route winds upwards through the vast caverns beneath Avrasol, climbing upwards until ships reach the caverns' mouth in Ethle l'Aciale @ipa['w]{ˈeɬ̪e laˈtsjale}, the Iron Valley. The caverns are constantly shifting, old routes collapsing and new routes opening. In order to make the crossing, a ship must hire an Irinan pilot from the Shipmasters' Guild, lest they dare tempt fate in the caves.

    @paragraph["Azathano"]{Azathano trees are large, trees with broad leaves native to Irina.}
