In order to recover spent spell slots, a spellcaster must release @emph{ahjari}@sidenote{Liquified magical fuel.} into the environment. The amount of spell points recovered is directly related to the volume of @emph{ahjari} used and its quality. There are four grades of @emph{ahjari}: raw, condensed, refined, and pure.
