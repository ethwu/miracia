The coun­try is sit­u­ated beneath the main con­ti­nent, Avra­sol, span­ning a vast arch­i­pel­ago of shat­tered isles. Elora only sees sun­light briefly at sun­rise and sun­set, as Avra­sol blocks the sun dur­ing the day, mak­ing the coun­try expe­ri­ence a seem­ingly end­less night, with only brief respite. That may be just as well, how­ever, as the mon­sters that thrive in the toxic depths of the world are embold­ened by the sun­light, and rise to wreak may­hem at those hours.</p><p>With­out the sun, Elora can­not sus­tain plant life. Instead, the isles are pop­u­lated by jun­gles of behe­moth fungi. Many have bio­lu­mi­nes­cence, and glow dur­ing the hours that the sun is invis­i­ble, attract­ing insects and other ani­mals. Fruits, veg­etable, and other plant-based foods are scarce, and must be shipped via air­ship.</p><p>Thanks to its prox­im­ity to the plan­e­tary core, Elora is rich in <em>aure</em>, and as <em>aure</em> sup­plies in the upper isles have been depleted, eyes have turned to Elora to fuel the fur­naces that turn the cogs of change. Min­ing oper­a­tions in Elora are vast and expan­sive, and acci­dents fre­quently result in entire isles col­laps­ing into the sea, but the gold is sorely needed in a nation with lit­tle else to offer. Out­lan­ders own most min­ing oper­a­tions.</p></section></article> </main> <nav class="navbox"> <div> <a class="prev-page" href="/miracia/locales/index.html"> Locales </a> </div> <div><a class="home-page" href="/miracia/index.html">Home</a></div> <div><a class="parent-page" href="/miracia/locales/index.html">Locales</a></div> <div> <a class="next-page" href="/miracia/locales/irina.html"> Irina </a> </div> </nav> <script async type="module" src="/miracia/dm/generators.58cea77a.js"></script> </body></html>
